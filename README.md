# CreditDefaults

# Dataset Breakdown:

The plan is to break everything down in the dataset by month. 
From there, the data will be separated further based on the different categories available, 
such as credit balance limit, marital status, sex, and education. 
Some of the categories will be combined into ranges, such as the balance limit and age. 
Although we have not determined the range yet, ideally we would want to have a breakdown resulting in only 4-6 different groupings.

Once the data has been grouped into data structures corresponding to the aforementioned attributes, the data will be averaged out.
This will allow us to have a granular view of the data, and create data points based on each of the attributes. 
It will also help us identify trends, for each attribute and overall. 
Additionally, this approach will allow us to process the data in smaller chunks and find outliers more easily.

Education (1-4, 1:grad school, 2:university, 3:highschool, 4:other)
